# Bike-Journey-Analytics
This project was part of the TTKO_7093 Statistical Data Analysis course at the Universiy of Turku.
It involved an extensive data analysis process, starting with an initial examination of the dataset to detect and address missing or invalid values, determine data types, and analyze general trends and characteristics. Following this, we performed some data cleaning and pre-processing, as well as some calculations of basic statistics for each variable. Data visualization techniques were also utilized to explore data distributions and uncover relationships between variables. Additionally, a hypothesis testing section was included to investigate statistical claims related to travel times, ticket types, and usage patterns, providing deeper insights into the dataset.
